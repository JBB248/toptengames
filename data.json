				"description": "This is my go to on the Wii. I love, love, love the edgy 2000's style that Mario Kart Wii goes for. This game feels like a true racing game. There are no coins. The handling is crisp. I prefer manually performing wheelies and tricks instead of the game automatically doing in later titles. My favorite part though is that this game is cruel. The computer players are merciless. They still give me, an experienced at long-time player, a tough time. Mario Kart Wii is one of the least balanced games of all time as well with a very defined tier list. You are considered deranged if you drive something that uses outside drift, but the vehicles such as the Wild Wing, the Wario Bike, and the Flame Flyer, some of my favorites, sport outside drift. But there's always a thrill in defying the meta. Playing online always provides hundreds of Funky Kongs on Flame Runners and Daisys on Mach Bikes, but that opens up the gates to be better. I like to play Luigi or King Boo or Toad and when I win, I revel in my victory. You've defeated the people who play the game for sport rather than for fun. You don't need a tier list to win. You've got real talent, and this is the game that I can prove it. Or at least it was. I haven't played it like that in some time and the online community is pretty dead. It's become my favorite time killer. I 100% the game, then I reset it and do it again. I've performed this cycle at least four times. I will always love Mario Kart Wii. Nothing will ever replace it in my heart, and that is why it is in my top three. Good job, Nintendo. Mario Kart Wii is truly a masterpiece."
