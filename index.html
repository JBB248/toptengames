                Video games are to me, as they are to many others, a big part of my life.
                <br/>
                They've taught me patience, given me a passion to solve puzzles, and, most of all,
                spurred in me a competitive drive that pushes me to be the very best.
                <br/>
                These are just a few of the games that I felt have truly impacted my life in the greatest ways.
