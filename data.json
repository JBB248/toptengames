I already loved FFVII Remake, and then they made it open world, sped up the combat by eleven, and added an awesome subplot involving an addictive minigame, Queen's Blood. Everything about this game is satisfying. The revamped ATB meter providing a moment to strategize, the Synergy Attacks taking back the tide of battle, and the Limit Breaks ending battles in the absolute flashiest form possible. This game has, without a doubt, my favorite combat of any video game I've ever played. My quest to 100% this game is still ongoing, and I will not give up until I reach the end.",
