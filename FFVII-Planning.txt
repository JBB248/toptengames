A sequel to the perfection that was FFVII Remake was a dream come true. Cloud Strife is my favorite character of all time, 
and he was always leading my party equipped with his iconic buster sword. 

I love every bit of this game (except the Cait Sith chapter and the late-game Chadley VR missions).

I had already considered FFVII Remake a perfect game, and then Square went and added an open world, added extra quests to do with party members, and sped up the combat by eleven.

Very few characters have the reputation and aura that Cloud Strife holds. This game was a dream come true. 
I already loved FFVII Remake, and then they made it open world, sped up the combat by eleven, and added an awesome subplot involving an addictive minigame, Queen's Blood. 
Everything about this game is satisfying. 
The revamped ATB meter providing a moment to strategize, the Synergy Attacks taking back the tide of battle, and the Limit Breaks ending battles in the absolute flashiest form possible. 
This game has, without a doubt, my favorite combat of any video game I've ever played. My quest to 100% this game is still ongoing, and I will not give up until I reach the end.
